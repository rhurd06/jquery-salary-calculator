## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

In this project I had to create a table with employee's information (first name, last name, ID number, job title and annual salary). This table had to be appended to the DOM, along with input boxes to potentially add more employees to the array. There needed to be a function that had to take the annual salaries and figure out a total monthly salary for all the employees. If that total was over $20,000 then the background behind the total needed to turn red.

I took this problem one step at a time, creating one function at a time. I checked each function as I went and updated them as needed.
